# My Memory Card App

This is a simple memory card app made for the Odin Project and eventually refactored to used React and Redux.
Redux was overkill because the state was so simple, I could have used useContext instead.

## Animations on the site come from Framer Motion v6

Each Jsx component with Framer properties have links to the appropriate parts of the Framer Motion docs.
https://www.framer.com/docs/

## The site was styled with Styled Components

Each JSX component has it's styling contained in the jsx file, not a separate CSS/SCSS file.
You can find their docs here. https://styled-components.com/docs

Thanks,
